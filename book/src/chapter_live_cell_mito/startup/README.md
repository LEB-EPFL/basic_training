# Microscope Startup

We will begin by starting up the microscope and its components.

## Instructions

### Step 0

Turn on the air pump and the environmental controls for the incubator.

It is good practice to turn these on 10 minutes or more before any experiment so that the environmental controls have a chance to stabilize.

Turn on the camera. You need not wait for the initialization to finish before turning on the control PC because the camera is connected via USB.

### Step 4

Wait until the Definite Focus controller's initialization has finished. (You can tell whether it has finished because it will no longer display a message indicating that it is initializing on its LCD display screen.)

Turn on the microscope.

### Step 5

Log into the computer with your EPFL username.

Find the shortcut to Micro-Manager on the desktop and double click it.

*2025-12-05*: This shortcut should point to `C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager-2.0\ImageJ.exe`. It is a slightly out-of-date version of Micro-Manager that is intended to support the CoolLED light source.

Click `OK` to continue.
