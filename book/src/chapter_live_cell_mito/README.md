# Live Cell Fluorescence Imaging of Mitochondria

In this section we will use a Zeiss Axio Observer 7 widefield fluorescence microscope to perform live cell imaging of mitochondria in U2OS cells. The cells have been modified to express [StayGold](https://www.fpbase.org/protein/staygold/) fluorescent protein that is targeting the mitochondrial matrix.
