## Instructions

### 0

Find the side of the right-angle mirror mount with a dot on it. Take this side to be the bottom.

![](./step_0.jpg)

### 1

Attach 4, 0.25" cage rods to the right-angle mirror mount as shown.

Attach 4, 1" cage rods to the other side.

![](./step_1.jpg)
![](./step_2.jpg)

### 2

Attach 4 cage rod adapters to the exterior of the 30 mm cage cube as shown.

Screw the lens tube containing the **emission** filter into the SM1 threaded hole on the same side as the cage rod adapters.

![](./step_3.jpg)
![](./step_4.jpg)

### 3

Attach the cage cube to the right-angle mirror mount using the 0.25" cage rods and cage rod adapters. Remember to keep the side of the right-angle mirror mount with the dot facing down.

![](./step_5.jpg)

### 4

Note the arrow on the side of the dichroic mirror. This arrow points to the side with the dielectric coating and should face towards the sample.

Insert the filter and its kinematic platform into the cage cube.

![](./step_7.jpg)
![](./step_8.jpg)

### 5

Rotate the platform by approximately 45 degrees, ensuring that the side of the dichroic mirror with the coating faces **away from the mirror**.

Tighten the screws on the cage cube. (They are imperial in the image shown!)

###6

Screw the lens tube containing the **excitation** filter into the cage cube.

![](./step_11.jpg)

### 7

Screw the SM1-threaded end cap into the hole on the cage cube that is opposite the excitation filter.

![](./step_12.jpg)

### 8

Attach 4, 2" long cage rods to the top of the cage cube.

![](./step_13.jpg)
![](./step_14.jpg)

### 9 

Slide the slip plate onto the ends of the cage rods. Lock it into place with the set screws.

### 10

Attach the cage system covers to the four sides of the 2" cage rod subassembly.
