# Learning Outcomes

## Fluorescence (Core) Module

The core module focuses on aspects of fluorescence microscopy because it is the central tool of our lab.

At the end of this training, a student should be able to:

### Identify the components of an epifluorescence microscope

- The students should know the names of the components when pointed to on the training microscope
- The students should be able to identify (approximately for hidden components) where on a real microscope the same components are located
- The students should be able to state the purpose of each component
- The students should be able to sketch a basic epifluorescence microscope from memory

### Assess the relative brightnesses of fluorescence signals

- The students should be able to acquire flourescence images at high SNR without saturation by tuning the microscope parameters while at the scope
- The students should know how to remove the effects of camera offset
- The students should know how to perform background subtraction and identify when it is necessary to do so
- The students should be able to estimate how much brighter the signal is in one fluorescence channel vs. another

### Measure the degree of fluorescence bleedthrough

- The students should be able to define what fluorescence bleedthrough is and explain why it is problematic
- The students should be able to perform the necessary measurements to assess bleedthrough
- The students should be able to explain what steps one might take to alleviate the effects of bleedthrough

## Optics Module

The purpose of the alignment module is to provide hands-on experience to students and post-docs who will build laboratory setups for fluorescence microscopy.

At the end of the alignment module, a student should be able to:

### Build and Align Optical Systems

- The students should be able to practice basic laser safety
- The students should be able to assemble Thorlabs components into a working optical system
- The students should be able to place a camera in the focal plane of a lens
- The students should be able to align lenses to a reference axis in 3D using a laser beam

### Control Microscope Hardware

- The students should be able to install and configure Micro-Manager
- The students should be able to send and receive serial commands from hardware
