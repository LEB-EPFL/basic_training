# Learning Outcomes

## Core Module

The core module focuses on fluorescence microscopy because it is the central tool of our lab.

At the end of this training, a student should be able to:

### Identify the components of an epifluorescence microscope

- The students should know the names of the components when pointed to on the training microscope
- The students should be able to identify (approximately for hidden components) where on a real microscope the same components are located
- The students should be able to state the purpose of each component
- The students should be able to sketch a basic epifluorescence microscope from memory

### Assess the relative brightnesses of fluorescence signals

- The students should be able to acquire flourescence images at high SNR without saturation by tuning the microscope parameters while at the scope
- The students should know how to remove the effects of camera offset
- The students should know how to perform background subtraction and identify when it is necessary to do so
- The students should be able to estimate how much brighter the signal is in one fluorescence channel vs. another
- The students should be able to estimate relative amounts of proteins, etc. by correcting fluorescence brightness for quantities such as quantum yield and absorption cross sections

### Measure the degree of fluorescence cross talk between channels

- The students should be able to define what fluorescence cross talk is and explain why it is problematic
- The students should be able to perform the necessary measurements to assess cross talk
- The students should be able to explain what steps one might take to alleviate the effects of cross talk
